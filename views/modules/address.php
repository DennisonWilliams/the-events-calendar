/**
 * Address Module Template
 * Render an address. This is used by default in the single event view.
 *
 * This view contains the filters required to create an effective address module view.
 *
 * You can recreate an ENTIRELY new address module by doing a template override, and placing
 * a address.php file in a tribe-events/modules/ directory within your theme directory, which
 * will override the /views/modules/address.php. 
 *
 * You can use any or all filters included in this file or create your own filters in 
 * your functions.php. In order to modify or extend a single filter, please see our
 * readme on templates hooks and filters (TO-DO)
